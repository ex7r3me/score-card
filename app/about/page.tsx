      Scorecard is a project where we aim to create digital and easy to use 
      versions of scorecards you usually se in a analog format. Like Yahtzee 
      and Golf and we would like to add more scorecards later on.
      The team treats this as a training project to practice and hone our 
      skills in modern web development and will only be working on this when
      we have time and opportunity.
