      Scorecard is a project where we aim to create digital and easy to use 
      versions of scorecards you usually se in analog format, like Yahtzee 
      and Golf. We would like to add more scorecards later on if given the opportunity.
      The team treats this as a training project to practice and hone our 
      skills in modern web development and will only be working on this when
      we have time and opportunity.
